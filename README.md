# Message Topic Cards

A Discourse theme component that transforms the personal messages list view into an elegant card-based layout.

## Features

- **Card-style layout** for personal messages instead of the default table view
- **Clean visual design** with consistent spacing and borders
- **Displays key information**:
  - Thread title with status indicators
  - Message sender/recipient (other participant)
  - Message excerpt
  - Activity date and reply count
- **Responsive design** with mobile optimizations
- **Seamless integration** with Discourse's theming system

## How It Works

The component automatically activates on personal message pages, replacing the standard table layout with card-based views. Each message displays as a distinct card showing:

1. **Title line**: The message thread title with any status icons (closed, archived, etc.)
2. **Participant line**: Avatar and username of the other participant (sender or recipient who isn't you)
3. **Excerpt line**: A preview of the message content
4. **Meta line**: Last activity date and reply count
